# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: Spec-Driven Guide Constitution

## Core Principles

### Educational Mission
The primary mission is to provide a comprehensive, practical textbook that bridges theoretical concepts with hands-on implementation in Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. All content must serve student learning outcomes and real-world application.

### Target Audience Focus
Content is specifically designed for undergraduate and early graduate Computer Science and Robotics engineers. Material must be accessible to students with foundational programming and mathematics knowledge, with concepts explained at appropriate depth for this demographic.

### Practical + Academic Balance
All chapters must maintain a balance between rigorous academic theory and practical implementation. Every theoretical concept requires corresponding code examples, laboratory exercises, or hardware implementations to reinforce learning.

### Comprehensive Scope Coverage
The textbook encompasses lectures, laboratory exercises, code examples, and hardware recipes. Each chapter must include multiple learning modalities: theoretical exposition, practical examples, experimental procedures, and implementation guides.

### Accessibility and Inclusion
Content must be written in clear, accessible English and include Urdu summaries for broader accessibility. All diagrams, code examples, and mathematical concepts must be explained in multiple formats to accommodate diverse learning needs.

### Reproducibility Standards
All experiments, code examples, and hardware implementations must include exact environment specifications, required datasets, and Docker/firmware build instructions. Every procedure must be independently verifiable and reproducible by readers.

## Licensing and Distribution

### MIT License Compliance
All code examples, laboratory procedures, and implementation guides are distributed under the MIT License. Clear attribution guidelines must be maintained for all third-party components and referenced materials.

### Open Source Contributions
Encourage community contributions and improvements to examples, exercises, and supporting materials. Maintain clear contribution guidelines and ensure all contributed content meets accessibility and reproducibility standards.

## Development Workflow

### Spec-Driven Approach
All content development follows a spec-driven methodology where learning objectives, chapter outlines, and assessment criteria are defined before implementation. Each chapter must have clear acceptance criteria and validation methods.

### Quality Assurance
All code examples must be tested in specified environments, hardware recipes validated with actual builds, and mathematical concepts verified for correctness. Peer review required for all technical content.

## Governance

Content must comply with all stated principles before publication. Updates require verification of continued adherence to accessibility, reproducibility, and educational effectiveness standards. All major revisions must undergo student testing and instructor feedback cycles.
