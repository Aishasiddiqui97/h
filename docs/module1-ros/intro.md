# Module 1: ROS 2 Nervous System

Welcome to the ROS 2 Nervous System module. In this module, you'll learn the fundamentals of ROS 2 architecture and communication patterns.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Understand ROS 2 architecture and core concepts
- Create and manage nodes, topics, services, and actions
- Implement publisher/subscriber patterns
- Work with service calls and action clients
- Build basic robot communication systems

## Overview

ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) provides the communication infrastructure for robotic systems. This module covers the essential components that form the "nervous system" of a robot, enabling different software components to communicate effectively.

## Topics Covered

- ROS 2 architecture and middleware
- Nodes and processes
- Topics and message passing
- Services and request/response patterns
- Actions and goal-oriented communication
- Quality of Service (QoS) settings
- Launch files and system composition

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python or C++ programming skills
- Understanding of Linux command line
- Familiarity with basic robotics concepts

Let's begin by exploring the ROS 2 architecture and how nodes communicate with each other.
