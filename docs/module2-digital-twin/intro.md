# Module 2: Digital Twin (Gazebo/Unity)

Welcome to the Digital Twin module. In this module, you'll learn how to create simulation environments using Gazebo and Unity for robotics applications.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Create and configure simulation environments
- Model robot physics and sensor systems
- Integrate with Gazebo simulation engine
- Work with Unity for advanced visualization
- Implement sensor simulation and data processing
- Validate robot behaviors in simulation

## Overview

A digital twin is a virtual representation of a physical system. In robotics, simulation environments allow us to test algorithms, validate behaviors, and develop complex systems without requiring physical hardware. This module covers simulation tools including Gazebo for physics-based simulation and Unity for advanced visualization.

## Topics Covered

- Simulation environments and physics engines
- Gazebo integration with ROS 2
- Robot modeling (URDF/SDF)
- Sensor simulation (cameras, LIDAR, IMU)
- Unity integration for advanced visualization
- Simulation control and monitoring
- Testing and validation in simulation

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of ROS 2 concepts (Module 1)
- Basic knowledge of physics and kinematics
- Familiarity with 3D modeling concepts

Let's start by exploring Gazebo simulation and how to create your first robot model in simulation.
